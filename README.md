****Stack in Swift****

This repository contains an implementation of a Stack data structure in Swift. A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, where elements can be added (pushed) and removed (popped) only from the top.

****Features****

**Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
**Pop**: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
**Peek**: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
